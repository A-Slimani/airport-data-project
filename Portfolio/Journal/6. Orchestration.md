Now that I have my scraper scripts and initial data processing complete I want to start to develop my pipeline orchestration. I will attempt to build my pipeline with Azure Data Factory. For this I will have to modify my current functions to use `HTTPTrigger` instead of `TimerTrigger` and let Azure Data Factory handle the scheduled runs of the scraper.
