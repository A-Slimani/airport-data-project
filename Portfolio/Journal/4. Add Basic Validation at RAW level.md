I need to ensure that the data is valid before trying to process it. I want to add some very basic validation at the raw level.
I have decided that I will ensure that the JSON file is 
- Not empty
- Flights are the correct date

For this I just modified my script to return an error if these scenarios are encountered.
```python
if data:
    return data
else:
    raise ValueError("Response returned valid but empty JSON")

```
