This will be my 2nd data engineering project that I will be undertaking. The reason for this is because I want to have a fresh start and work on something that could be more business relevant and help secure a role as a data engineer. For this I have picked analysing airport data specifically Sydney however I will want to eventually branch out to different airports within Australia and then the world.

## Getting / finding data source

As of now I have two options in regards to data sources. Scraping through airport websites OR using APIs. With scraping data and availability can be inconsistent, however it is free. API's on the other hand will have better data structure, quality and availability but it has the potential to be costly. 

I think my best option will try to find a free API endpoint and formulate a way to make API calls stay within a free tier limit. 

So far I have come across this [AeroDataBox API](https://doc.aerodatabox.com/#rapidapi/description/introduction) that will allow me to get data for a 12 hour window that goes back to 180 days. My limitation however is that I have a limit of 150 calls per month so I would have to call the API 60 times a month for one airport. This will have a limit of two airports to analyse making it hard to go this route. 

I will try to go with the web scraping route by first checking any API endpoints being called from the website and using that as my data source. I think this is a better route for a portfolio project because I can show off my skills in handling unprocessed and unformatted data into data that can be used for analytics. I then can use the API to fill in missing gaps or slowly collect historical data or airports so that I will have a more comprehensive dataset to work with.


## Web Scraping - Sydney Airport

Starting with Sydney Airport fortunately I found an exposed API endpoint that is being called on the website.

Looking at the endpoint the API is split by flight locality (domestic, international) and flight direction (arrival, departure). 

I plan on scraping this with python and then dumping the json into a bucket for later ingestion into a DB for analysis.
